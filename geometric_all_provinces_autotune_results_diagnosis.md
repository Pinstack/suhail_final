# Geometric Pipeline Hang Diagnosis Report

## 1. Process and System State
- The main pipeline process (`python -m src.meshic_pipeline.run_geometric_pipeline --saudi-arabia`, PID 30053) is still running and using significant CPU.
- No new log output or file writes since 10:02 AM, indicating a stall.
- No evidence of OS-level deadlock or resource exhaustion.

## 2. Log Analysis
- The log (`geometric_all_provinces_autotune_results.txt`) is filled with 404 warnings for missing tiles.
- No log entries indicate successful tile downloads or saves; all tile requests in the log are 404s.
- No evidence in the log of any tile being successfully downloaded or cached.

## 3. Profiler (py-spy) Results
- The main thread is blocked on an `asyncio` lock in `fetch_tile` (in `async_tile_downloader.py`).
- This suggests a Python-level deadlock or starvation scenario, likely related to semaphore usage for concurrency control.
- No evidence of database or network blocking at the OS level.

## 4. Code Review: async_tile_downloader.py
- The `fetch_tile` method uses an `asyncio.Semaphore` to limit concurrency.
- If a lock is not released (e.g., due to an exception or logic bug), all workers can become blocked waiting for the semaphore.
- The code previously did not have logging around semaphore acquisition or timeouts for lock acquisition.

## 5. Remediation Steps Taken
- Added logging before and after semaphore acquisition in `fetch_tile`.
- Added a 30-second timeout to semaphore acquisition using `asyncio.wait_for`.
- Added logging for timeout events and ensured semaphore is released on all code paths.

## 6. Next Steps
- Re-run the pipeline and monitor for new log messages about semaphore acquisition and timeouts.
- If timeouts occur, investigate further for logic bugs or unhandled exceptions in tile download logic.
- Consider further reducing concurrency or adding more granular error handling if deadlocks persist.
