# Pipeline Enrichment Bottleneck: Forensic Report

## Overview

This report documents a critical bottleneck in the geospatial data pipeline for parcel enrichment. It is intended for developers and stakeholders unfamiliar with the project, providing all necessary context, evidence, and next steps to resolve the issue.

---

## 1. Pipeline Context

- The pipeline processes geospatial parcel data and attempts to enrich each parcel with administrative identifiers: `municipality_id` and `region_id`.
- Enrichment is performed by spatially joining parcels with reference tables: `municipalities` and `neighborhoods`.
- Reference data must be present in these tables for enrichment to succeed.

---

## 2. Current Database State (as of latest run)

### Reference Tables

| Table           | Row Count | Notes                |
|-----------------|-----------|----------------------|
| municipalities  | 0         | **Empty**            |
| neighborhoods   | 7         | Populated            |

### Parcel Data

| Table   | Row Count |
|---------|-----------|
| parcels | 9,007     |

### Enrichment Outcome

| Condition                                 | Count  |
|-------------------------------------------|--------|
| Parcels missing municipality_id or region_id | 9,007  |

## 3. Evidence

- **Query:** `SELECT COUNT(*) FROM municipalities;`
  - **Result:** 0 rows
- **Query:** `SELECT COUNT(*) FROM neighborhoods;`
  - **Result:** 7 rows
- **Query:** `SELECT COUNT(*) FROM parcels;`
  - **Result:** 9,007 rows
- **Query:** `SELECT COUNT(*) FROM parcels WHERE municipality_id IS NULL OR region_id IS NULL;`
  - **Result:** 9,007 rows

---

## 4. Root Cause

- The `municipalities` table is empty. No municipality boundaries or IDs are available for enrichment.
- The `neighborhoods` table is minimally populated (7 records), which may be insufficient for full coverage, but the primary bottleneck is the empty `municipalities` table.
- The pipeline does not check for or load reference data before attempting enrichment.

---

## 5. Impact

- **All 9,007 parcels are missing `municipality_id` and/or `region_id`.**
- Downstream analytics, reporting, and applications relying on these fields will be incomplete or incorrect.
- The pipeline is not robust or scalable, as it requires manual population of reference data before each run.

---

## 6. Recommendations (Fact-Based)

1. **Automate Reference Data Checks**
   - Add a pipeline step to check for required reference data (`municipalities`, `neighborhoods`) before enrichment.
2. **Fail Fast on Missing Data**
   - If reference data is missing, halt the pipeline and raise a clear error. Do not proceed with enrichment.
3. **Document Reference Data Requirements**
   - Clearly document which reference tables are required, their expected sources, and how to populate them.

---

## 7. Next Steps for Developers

- Do not attempt to enrich or analyze parcels until the `municipalities` table is populated with valid data.
- Add a pre-enrichment check in the pipeline to ensure all required reference data is present.
- If reference data is not available, obtain it from an authoritative source and load it into the database before running the pipeline.

## 8. Supporting Data (Direct Evidence)

```
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM municipalities;      -- 0
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM neighborhoods;       -- 7
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM parcels;             -- 9007
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM parcels WHERE municipality_id IS NULL OR region_id IS NULL; -- 9007
```
