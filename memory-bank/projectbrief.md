# Project Brief: Suhail Geospatial Data Pipeline

## Project Overview
Comprehensive MVT-based geospatial data processing and API enrichment pipeline for Riyadh real estate parcels. Currently processing central Riyadh region with plans for metropolitan area expansion.

## Core Specifications

### **Current Scale (Development/Testing)**
- **Coverage**: Central Riyadh test region (3x3 tile grid)
- **Data Volume**: 9,007 land parcels with complete geometry
- **Processing**: 9 MVT tiles at zoom level 15
- **Geographic Area**: ~3.7 kmÂ² test coverage

### **Production Scale Goals**
- **Target Coverage**: Full Riyadh metropolitan area
- **Future Grid**: Larger tile coverage (TBD based on testing)
- **Projected Volume**: Scale up from current 9K parcels
- **Layers**: 15 geospatial layers (parcels, neighborhoods, transport, etc.)

## Requirements

1. **MVT Processing**: Decode Mapbox Vector Tiles to PostGIS geometries
2. **API Enrichment**: Integrate with Suhail API for transaction and zoning data  
3. **Data Integrity**: Maintain referential integrity with proper foreign keys
4. **Performance**: Sub-second spatial queries on current dataset
5. **Scalability**: Architecture ready for metropolitan area expansion

## Technical Constraints

- **Database**: PostgreSQL with PostGIS spatial extensions
- **API Endpoint**: api2.suhail.ai for enrichment data
- **Tile Server**: tiles.suhail.ai for MVT data
- **Processing**: Python/SQLAlchemy with async capabilities
- **Deployment**: Development environment with production readiness

## Success Criteria

### **Phase 1 (Current - Complete)**
- âœ… 9,007 parcels successfully processed and stored
- âœ… All 15 geospatial layers integrated
- âœ… PostGIS spatial indexing operational
- âœ… Foreign key relationships established

### **Phase 2 (Next)**
- ðŸŽ¯ Expand tile grid coverage
- ðŸŽ¯ Process additional Riyadh districts
- ðŸŽ¯ Optimize for larger datasets
- ðŸŽ¯ Production deployment preparation

## Deliverables

1. **Geometric Pipeline**: Complete MVT processing system
2. **Enrichment Pipeline**: API integration with 5 strategies
3. **Database Schema**: 19 tables with proper relationships
4. **CLI Tools**: Operational command interface
5. **Documentation**: Comprehensive setup and operation guides
